# **1. Project Background**

Cloud High-Performance Computing - **Cloud HPC**, differs from on-premise HPC significantly. Cloud service brings high scalability and flexibility to High-Performance Computing. However, most HPC users are not familiar with building and maintaining HPC services in the cloud. The technical barrier of cloud computing is very high to researchers, engineers, and developers in different scientific and engineering domains, e.g. energy, chemistry, physics, materials, bioscience. 

In order to make it super easy to start and manage HPC workloads in the cloud, we have been developing this project: HPC-NOW. **NOW** stands for:

- Start HPC workloads in the cloud **NOW**, immediately, in minutes.
- Manage HPC workloads with (almost) **N**o **O**peration **W**orkload.

Currently, the HPC-NOW platform supports 8 popular cloud platforms, shown as below:

- [Alibaba Cloud](https://www.alibabacloud.com/en), HPC-NOW Internal Code: CLOUD_A
- [Tencent Cloud](https://www.tencentcloud.com/), HPC-NOW Internal Code: CLOUD_B
- [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/), HPC-NOW Internal Code: CLOUD_C
- [Huawei Cloud](https://www.huaweicloud.com/), HPC-NOW Internal Code: CLOUD_D
- [Baidu BCE](https://cloud.baidu.com/), HPC-NOW Internal Code: CLOUD_E
- [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/), HPC-NOW Internal Code: CLOUD_F
- [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/), HPC-NOW Internal Code: CLOUD_G
- [Volcano Engine by ByteDance](https://www.volcengine.com/), HPC-NOW Internal Code: CLOUD_H

*DEMO: How easy it is to create a cloud HPC cluster using HPC-NOW?*

# **2. Core Components**

Thanks to [Terraform](http://www.terraform.io) and [openTofu](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu) for making it possible to orchestrate cloud resources in a unified and simple way.

In this project, we are developing several components:

-  **installer**  : HPC-NOW service installer. It requires **temporary** administrator or root privilege to run [why?](#35-the-installer-commands).
-  **hpcopr**     : HPC Operator. The main component that manages the HPC clusters, users, jobs, data, monitoring, usage, etc.
-  **now-crypto** : An independent cryptography module (**AES-128-ECB-PKCS#7**) that encrypts and decrypts the files containing sensitive information.
-  **hpcmgr**    : A utility running in every cluster's master node to communicate with the operator.
-  **infra-as-code** : Infrastructure codes in HCL format.
-  **scripts**    : Shell scripts to initialize the clusters, install applications, etc.

The high-level architecture of this project is:

<img src="./img/arch.png" alt="architecture" style="width: 600px;"/>

# **3. How-To: Build, Install, Run, and Use**

The HPC-NOW platform is very easy to build, run, and use. It is also cross-platform, which means you can run the HPC-NOW on Microsoft Windows, GNU/Linux (with APT, DNF or YUM), and macOS (Darwin). 

**Note 1**: Currently only **x86_64** platform is supported. If you are using other cpu platforms, please let us know.

**Note 2**: Instead of compiling/building from the source code, you can download pre-built executables/binaries from the release of this repository. In this case, the dev/build tools (`git`, `gcc`, `clang`, or `mingw-w64`) are **NOT** needed.

**Note 3**: The HPC-NOW relies on some fundamental system utilities. In most cases, these utilities have been included in the OS distros. See the list below. If you are not sure whether the utilities are installed or not, please run the commands in a terminal/command prompt window.

- **Microsoft Windows**: `curl` `tar` `ssh` `scp`
- **GNU/Linux Distros**: `curl` `tar` `unzip` `ssh` `scp`
- **macOS (Darwin)**   : `curl` `tar` `unzip` `ssh` `scp`

*If the utility `curl` is not pre-installed, please manually install it from the [official site](https://curl.se/download.html) or with the package manager (e.g. yum, apt), and add the PATH to the system environment variables. Usually, `tar`, `unzip` `ssh` and `scp` are pre-installed.*

## **3.1 Build**

### **Prerequisites** 

- Use [git](https://git-scm.com/) for code management.
- Use a standard C compiler. This project **required**:
  -  [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/) for **GNU/Linux distros**. You can get it easily with the package manager (E.g. `yum`).
  -  [clang](https://clang.llvm.org/) for **macOS (Darwin)**. Please install it by running the command `clang`. If clang is absent, macOS would ask you for installing it automatically.
  -  [mingw-w64 (with POSIX)](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/) for **Microsoft Windows**, **POSIX support is a must**. We recommend **MinGW-W64 GCC-8.1.0-x86_64-posix-sjlj** , you can go to [this link](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/) and find it. Download the tarball -> Unzip it to a directory -> Add the full path of the `bin` subdirectory to the `$PATH` environment variable.

### **Step 1. Clone this repository** 

`git clone https://github.com/zhenrong-wang/hpc-now`

If your connectivity to github is not stable, you can also try to clone from gitee:

`git clone https://gitee.com/zhenrong-wang/hpc-now`

### **Step 2. Change the directory** 

`cd hpc-now`

### **Step 3. Run the build script** 

- For **Microsoft Windows**: `.\make_windows.bat build`
- For **GNU/Linux Distro** : `chmod +x make_linux.sh && ./make_linux.sh build`
- For **macOS (Darwin)**   : `chmod +x make_darwin.sh && ./make_darwin.sh build`

If everything goes well, the binaries will be built to the `build` folder.

## **3.2 Install**

### **Step 1. Run the installer**

**Temporary** Administrator or root privilege is required to run the installer [why?](#35-the-installer-commands).

- For **Microsoft Windows** : 
    
    Step 1. Open a Command Prompt **as Administrator**: 

        - Type 'cmd' in the search box
        - Right click on the icon of the Command Prompt
        - Select 'Run as Administrator'

    Step 2. Change direcroty to the `build` folder: 
    
    Suppose your local repo path is `c:\users\public\hpc-now`, then the command should be:
    
    `cd c:\users\public\hpc-now\build`

    Step 3. Run the command below:

    Suppose your installer version code is 0.3.2, hpcopr version code is 0.3.2, then the command should be:

    `.\installer-win-0.3.2.exe install --hloc hpcopr-win-0.3.2.exe --cloc now-crypto-aes-win.exe`

- For **GNU/Linux Distros** : 

    Suppose your installer version code is 0.3.2, hpcopr version code is 0.3.2, then the command should be:

    `sudo ./installer-lin-0.3.2.exe install --hloc hpcopr-lin-0.3.2.exe --cloc now-crypto-aes-lin.exe`

- For **macOS(Darwin)**:

    Suppose your installer version code is 0.3.2, hpcopr version code is 0.3.2, then the command should be:

    `sudo ./installer-dwn-0.3.2.exe install --hloc hpcopr-dwn-0.3.2.exe --cloc now-crypto-aes-dwn.exe`

**IMPORTANT**: Please replace the sample version code `0.3.2` with the real code of your own build.

**IMPORTANT**: Please keep the window open for the next step.

### **Step 2. Initialize the hpcopr**

The `hpcopr.exe` is designed to be executed by the dedicated system OS user named `hpc-now`, which has been created by the installer in the last step.

In order to run the `hpcopr.exe`, you'll need to set a password and switch to that user. See the steps below:

- For **Microsoft Windows**:

    - Set a password for the user 'hpc-now' : `net user hpc-now YOUR_COMPLEX_PASSWORD`
    - Run a new cmd window as 'hpc-now'     : `runas /savecred /user:mymachine\hpc-now cmd`
    - Run the main program 'hpcopr.exe'     : `hpcopr envcheck`

- For **GNU/Linux Distros**:

    - Set a password for the user 'hpc-now' : `sudo passwd hpc-now`
    - Switch to the user 'hpc-now'          : `su hpc-now`
    - Run the main program 'hpcopr.exe'     : `hpcopr envcheck`

- For **macOS(Darwin)**:

    - Set a password for the user 'hpc-now' : `sudo dscl . -passwd /Users/hpc-now YOUR_COMPLEX_PASSWORD`
    - Switch to the user 'hpc-now'          : `su hpc-now`
    - Run the main program 'hpcopr.exe'     : `hpcopr envcheck`

Several extra packages (around 500 MB) will be downloaded and installed. This process may needs minutes (depending on your internet connectivity).

**NOTE 1:** For UNIX-like OS, it is not necessary to set a password for 'hpc-now' and switch to it in the terminal. You can just run `hpcopr.exe` with `sudo -Hu hpc-now` prefix. e.g.:

`sudo -Hu hpc-now hpcopr envcheck`  *The -Hu specifies the user hpc-now and its home directory*

This method is only valid for **sudoers**.

**NOTE 2:** If you are using a GNU/Linux distro with desktop envrionment (E.g. Debian with GNOME), after switching to the user *hpc-now* in a terminal, your desktop environment may not be authorized to *hpc-now* by default. The `hpcopr rdp --copypass` function would not work properly. Please follow the instructions below:

- Run command `source /etc/profile` to authorize the user *hpc-now* to use the current desktop environment.
- Add `source /etc/profile` to the `~/.bashrc` file using a text editor. E.g. `gedit ~/.bashrc`.

## **3.3 Run**

The `hpcopr` is the main CLI for you to run. Please see the description above.

If you'd like to update/uninstall the HPC-NOW services, you will need to run the `installer` with `sudo`(for UNIX-like OS) or **as administrator**(for Windows).

## **3.4 Basic Workflow**

In order to use and manage HPC in the cloud with HPC-NOW, please follow the workflow:

- Import a cloud credential - a keypair or key file (**`hpcopr new-cluster ...`**) --> 
- Initialize a new cluster (**`hpcopr init ...`**) --> 
- Deploy an application (**`hpcopr appman ...`**) -->
- Upload your data (**`hpcopr dataman ...`**) -->
- Connect to your cluster (**`hpcopr ssh ...`** OR **`hpcopr rdp ...`**) -->
- Start your HPC work (**`hpcopr jobman ...`**) -->
- Waiting for the job to be done - **may be minutes, hours, or days ...**
- Export your HPC data to local or other places (**`hpcopr dataman ...`**) -->
- Hibernate the cluster (*optional*, **`hpcopr sleep ...`**) -->
- Destroy the cloud cluster (**`hpcopr destroy ...`**) -->
- Remove the cloud credentials (optional, **`hpcopr remove ...`**)

*DEMO: An example of an HPC-NOW cluster running Paraview*

<img src="./img/run_paraview.png" alt="example" style="width: 600px;"/>

## **3.5 The Installer Commands**

The **`installer`** is designed to manage the installation/update/removal of the HPC-NOW services. It needs temporary administrator privilege to:

- Add/delete the dedicated system user 'hpc-now'
- Change the ownership and/or permissions of the key working directories
- Use system-level package manager to install packages such as wget, zip/unzip, in case the packages are absent

**We follow the least privilege principle**. Please check the [source code directory of installer](./installer/).

**NOTE:**

*1. All the directories and files except the .now_crypto_seed.lock are set to be readable, writable, and executable only by the system user hpc-now.*

*2. The .now_crypto_seed.lock file is set to be readable only by root/Admin and hpc-now. And it is NOT writable even for root/Admin.*

*3. Manually modification of the .now_crypto_seed.lock file will destroy the whole HPC-NOW because you may not be able to decrypt critical files.*
